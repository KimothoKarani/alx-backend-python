This project focuses on learning the fundamentals of software testing in Python, covering unit tests, integration tests, mocking, and parameterization.

## Learning Objectives

*   The difference between unit and integration tests.
    
*   Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations, and fixtures.
    
*   How to use the `unittest` and `unittest.mock` modules.
    
*   How to write effective tests for functions and classes.
    

## Files
